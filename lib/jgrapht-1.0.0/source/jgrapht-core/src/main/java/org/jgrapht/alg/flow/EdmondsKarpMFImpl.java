/**
 * A <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network">flow network</a> is a directed graph
 * where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge can
 * not exceed the capacity of the edge (note, that all capacities must be non-negative). A flow must
 * satisfy the restriction that the amount of flow into a vertex equals the amount of flow out of
 * it, except when it is a source, which "produces" flow, or sink, which "consumes" flow.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class computes maximum flow in a network using
 * <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds-Karp_algorithm">Edmonds-Karp algorithm</a>. Be
 * careful: for large networks this algorithm may consume significant amount of time (its
 * upper-bound complexity is O(VE^2), where V - amount of vertices, E - amount of edges in the
 * network).
 *
 * <p>
 * This class can also computes minimum s-t cuts. Effectively, to compute a minimum s-t cut, the
 * implementation first computes a minimum s-t flow, after which a BFS is run on the residual graph.
 *
 * <p>
 * For more details see Andrew V. Goldberg's <i>Combinatorial Optimization (Lecture Notes)</i>.
 *
 * Note: even though the algorithm accepts any kind of graph, currently only Simple directed and
 * undirected graphs are supported (and tested!).
